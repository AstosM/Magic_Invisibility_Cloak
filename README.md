# 🧙‍♂ Magic Invisibility Cloak (Python + OpenCV + numpy)

Ever dreamed of owning *Harry Potter’s invisibility cloak*?  
This project makes it real (well, almost 😉).

## 🚀 How it works
- Wear or hold a *red cloth* in front of the camera.  
- The app detects the red region and replaces it with:  
  - The background (classic invisibility)  
  - A custom image (inter-dimensional cloak)  

Built using:
- ⚡ Python
- ⚡ OpenCV
