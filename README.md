# 🧙‍♂ Magic Invisibility Cloak (Python + OpenCV + Gradio)

Ever dreamed of owning *Harry Potter’s invisibility cloak*?  
This project makes it real (well, almost 😉).

## 🚀 How it works
- Wear or hold a *red cloth* in front of the camera.  
- The app detects the red region and replaces it with:  
  - The background (classic invisibility)  
  - A custom image (inter-dimensional cloak)  

Built using:
- ⚡ Python
- ⚡ OpenCV
- ⚡ Gradio (for easy web app deployment)

## 🔧 How to run locally
```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/invisibility-cloak
cd invisibility-cloak
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
